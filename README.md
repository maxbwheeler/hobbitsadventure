# Hobbit's Adventure

This is a project that I (Willie Wheeler) am doing with my sons Max (age 9) and Jude (age 6) to help them learn computer programming.

### Key learning principles

Here are some of the key ideas behind the educational aspect of this project:

* Intrinsic motivation is key to learning. My kids really like Minecraft, so creating a game seems like a good match.
* To keep learners engaged, look for direct connections between their interests and the subject being learned. There's not much in my kids' experience yet to interest them directly in 2d arrays, but I can get there eventually through creating world maps and dungeon maps.

### Approach

Based on those ideas, right now (start of project), I wrote a very small game engine and the kids are starting out doing map creation. They aren't programming yet, but that's fine, because they're really getting involved in creating the game. And they are learning some key foundational concepts and skills:

* **Using the IDE:** editing and saving files, edit-build-run cycle
* **Working on a team:** negotiating design and work, sharing code through GitHub
* **Agility and prototyping:** the understanding that you want to start out by just getting things working, and that you can come back later and improve things when the time is right
* **Code vs. configuration:** e.g., configure startup map, turn "god mode" on or off (e.g. to walk through walls and across water). Also this teaches that certain things are harder to change than other things.
* **Rudimentary programming tasks:** e.g., creating new tile types, changing tile characteristics
* **The concept of representations:** symbols in the map file correspond to objects in the game
* **Pickiness:** the understanding that the computer is very picky about syntax
* **Bugs:** the understanding that bugs happen
* **Architecture:** general architectural concepts, such as the distinction between a game server and game clients, and their respective responsibilities
